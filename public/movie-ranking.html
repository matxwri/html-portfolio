<h1>The Best Anime Series According to Matt</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime of All Time </h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Sword Art Online</h3>
    <p>Sword Art Online was the very first anime that I had ever completed. <br> I was mesmorized by the story as well as the characters within it, <br> and it easily became one of my all-time favorites. A must-watch for sure!</p>

<h3>2. Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
    <p>Tokyo Ghoul was an anime that a friend might have mentioned that I <br> watch and I eventually did. The introduction was very innocent-like <br> and then BOOM!, everything turns to chaos. The emotion within this series <br> kept me intrested through to the end and it will always be in my top favorites.</p>

<h3>3. Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>Packed with action and fighting throughout the entire series, Demon Slayer is <br> an anime that you can't take your eyes off. Phenomonal storyline with breathtaking <br> artstyle, everything about this anime is simply just amazing. I was very disappointed <br> to see it end and am hoping for more in the future.</p>
